- Tool that lists the contents of a directory
- Use this tool when you need to explore directory structure or see what files/folders exist
- CRITICAL: Always provide a relative path from the project root
- Use "." for the current directory or specify a subdirectory path like "src" or "src/core"
- The tool shows all files and directories including hidden ones (starts with .)
- If no path provided, defaults to the current working directory
- Results are truncated to 100 entries if directory has many items
- Do not ask user any questions
