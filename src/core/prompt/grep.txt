- Tool that searches for content within files in a codebase using ripgrep
- Use this tool when you need to find specific text, patterns, or code within files
- CRITICAL: Always use recursive search patterns that search through all subdirectories
- Use regex patterns for complex searches, simple strings for exact matches
- Use the include parameter to filter by file types (e.g. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}", "*.py")
- If no matches found, try a more generic pattern or different file types
- The search is case-sensitive by default - use (?i) prefix for case-insensitive searches
- Do not ask user any questions
