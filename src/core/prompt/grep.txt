- Tool that searches for content within files in a codebase using ripgrep
- Use this tool when you need to find specific text, patterns, or code within files
- CRITICAL: Always use recursive search patterns that search through all subdirectories
- CRITICAL: Focus on searching for names of things (variables, functions, classes, etc.) rather than language-specific syntax
- CRITICAL: For the path parameter, you can use either absolute paths or relative paths from the project root
- CRITICAL: If you want to search the entire project, OMIT the path parameter entirely (do not set it)
- CRITICAL: Start with broad searches (omit path parameter) to find where the content exists
- CRITICAL: If you're unsure about the exact file path, search the entire project first, then narrow down
- If no matches found, try a more generic pattern or different file types
- The search is case-sensitive by default - use (?i) prefix for case-insensitive searches
- Do not ask user any questions
