- Tool that searches for content within files in a codebase using ripgrep
- Use this tool when you need to find specific text, patterns, or code within files
- Patterns are treated as REGEX, not literal text
- If searching for literal text that contains special regex characters (like parentheses, brackets, dots, asterisks, plus signs, question marks, etc.), you MUST escape them with backslashes
- Examples: To search for "def function_name(" use "def function_name\\(" - To search for "function()" use "function\\(\\)"
- Focus on searching for names of things (variables, functions, classes, etc.) rather than language-specific syntax
- For the path parameter, you can use either relative paths from the project root or leave it blank which would default to project root
- Start with broad searches (omit path parameter) to find where the content exists
- If no matches found, try a more generic pattern or different file types
- The search is case-sensitive by default - use (?i) prefix for case-insensitive searches
