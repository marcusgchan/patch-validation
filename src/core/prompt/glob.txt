- Tool that searches for files in a codebase by name patterns
- Use this tool when you need to find files by their names or paths
- CRITICAL: Always use recursive glob patterns that start with **/ to search through all subdirectories
- NEVER use non-recursive patterns - they only search the root directory

COMMON PATTERNS:
- Find files by name: "**/filename*" (matches filename with any extension)
- Find files by extension: "**/*.ts", "**/*.js", "**/*.json"
- Find files containing text in name: "**/*filename*"
- Find files in specific folder: "**/src/**/*" or "**/src/*"
- Find all files: "**/*" (matches everything)

- If no files found, try a more generic pattern or check if the path structure is different
- Do not ask user any questions
