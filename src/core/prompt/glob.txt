- Tool that searches for files in a codebase by name patterns
- Use this tool when you need to find files by their names or paths
- CRITICAL: Always use recursive glob patterns that start with **/ to search through all subdirectories
- NEVER use non-recursive patterns - they only search the root directory
- If looking for files in a specific folder, use "**/folderName/*" or "**/folderName/**/*"
- If no files found, try a more generic pattern or check if the path structure is different
- Do not ask user any questions
