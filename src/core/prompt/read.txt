- Tool that reads file contents from the codebase
- Call grep, glob, or ls tools before this tool to get full file paths
- Use this tool when you need to examine the contents of a specific file
- CRITICAL: Always use absolute filepaths - never use relative paths
- Get absolute paths from other tools (like glob tool results) or construct them from project root
- Specify the starting line number (1-indexed) to begin reading from
- Optionally specify how many lines to read (defaults to 300 lines)
- Returns file contents with line numbers for easy reference
- If file doesn't exist, verify the absolute path is correct
- If you need to read more of the file, use the next start line number provided in metadata
- Do not ask user any questions
