- Tool that reads file contents from the codebase and use this tool when you need to examine the contents of a specific file
- Call grep, glob, or ls tools before this tool to get full file paths
- CRITICAL: Always use absolute filepaths - never use relative paths
- CRITICAL: NEVER read the entire file unless absolutely necessary - always read only the specific function or section you need
- When you have a line number from grep results, start reading from that line and read only the relevant function/section
- Default behavior should be to read lines starting from the specific line number, not the whole file
- Specify the starting line number (1-indexed) to begin reading from
- Always specify a reasonable count parameter (50-80 lines) to limit the amount of content read
- Returns file contents with line numbers for easy reference
- If you need to read more of the file, use the nextInclusiveStartLineNumber provided in metadata
- If file doesn't exist, verify the absolute path is correct
- Do not ask user any questions
